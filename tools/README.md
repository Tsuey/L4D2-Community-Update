This is a Debug Mutation that prints the concept that is fired and in the table below it, all the usable criterias with each having the exact value upon the frame they were fired. This is best done in Single Player so that you can actually freeze the game to check. Keep in mind that many concepts have been blocked because they tend to flood the console.
