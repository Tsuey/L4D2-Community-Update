## Campaign Changes

:::info
The changes below apply to *both* campaign mode and versus mode. However, versus mode has a lot of extra changes which you will have to check the PVP changelog to see. They are simply too extensive to list here. Thank you!
:::

:::info
I would personally suggest to look at the new clipping changes with these new script functions:
`script ShowUpdate()` `script HideUpdate()`
In order to use these you must be running the game in developer mode. 
Add `-dev` to your launch options for L4D2.

### Campaign Mode Clipping Q&A

**How do you give feedback?**
You can discuss your thoughts on the [**L4DNation Discord**](https://discord.gg/SUb5aXUK6g), or if you would prefer you could contact Failzz (failzz#2940), Jacob (jcb#9679), or Tsuey (G-Force#7777) directly. You can also comment on this HackMD list. If you are unsure what to give feedback on you can simply state whether you would prefer more player freedom in Campaign mode. However, I would strongly suggest going through the list of proposed changes before forming an opinion.

---
**How do I view the new clips?**
Please run the game with `-dev` in your launch options, and use the `script ShowUpdate()` command in console to view the new clips, and `script HideUpdate()` to hide them. 

Tutorial on how to use the commands:
{%youtube eKrOtGaLWAs %}

---

**Why are we deciding to do this?**
We tried to ensure that the clipping we added was not too restrictive during development, however we have been talking with players since TLS released about the clipping changes for Campaign mode. Based on the feedback we have received we feel that some of the changes are too restrictive for a casual gamemode. We want to look into potentially less restrictive ways of fixing these issues. Our main goal is to ensure all players are able to have fun playing L4D2!

---

**What will stay fixed?**
We will still be blocking off anything that could be seen as game breaking, or could be used to potentially ruin other players&#39; experiences. We will only be removing clips that we deemed unnecessary. This includes redundant clips, clips that were only meant for versus mode, and clips we feel are too restrictive. However, we will be looking into alternative ways of fixing or deterring players from doing certain skips that does not involve blocking them completely.

---

**Shouldn&#39;t skips be fixed though?**
Contrary to what many people believe this is subjective. Not all developers fix skips and tricks that players figure out. This depends on how much freedom the player is intended to have, and in casual games it is generally fine to give the player more freedom to explore. In competitive PvP games these things are generally fixed though, which is why Versus mode is being handled differently.

---

**What about griefers and rushers?**
These are much bigger issues than just skips that players can do. Fixing skips with clipping is one way to approach this, but we want to look into alternative methods that are not as restrictive. Try to keep in mind that not all players who rush or use skips are griefers, and some of these people only play Singleplayer or Friends Only games.

---

**What does Valve think about this?**
We asked Kerry (Valve employee) about his thoughts on the rollercoaster skip on Dark Carnival. Here is a direct quote:
&gt; You&#39;re right, in non-competitive modes it&#39;s usually best to err on the side of letting people just have fun. I don&#39;t know for sure about the coaster - my guess is the LD intended for the survivors to play the coaster in full, but when the skip was discovered it wasn&#39;t considered to be an issue worth changing. If you&#39;re performing the skip, you&#39;re probably a pretty experienced player who has already played the map the &#34;correct&#34; way numerous times anyway.

To keep yourself up to date on the latest changes being made check [**Tsuey&#39;s Github.**](https://github.com/Tsuey/L4D2-Community-Update)

Below is the list of clips that we are proposing to make Versus exclusive.

Commentary blockers will be changed in the future, but can be ignored for now. Primary focus is on the new clipping introduced in TLS update.

- [ ] Blank checkboxes indicate the clip has not been changed.
- [x] Marked checkboxes indicate the clip has been changed on the current release version of the game.
- [ ] ~~clip_name_here~~ Crossed out names indicate we do not plan to change this clip at the current time (subject to change). You can ignore these for now.

### Valve's C++ Changelog

The Last Stand Community Update has been released!
Visit https://www.l4d.com/laststand/ for all of the details.

Summary of the more than 1000 changes across the entire game:

- Fixed an exploit that could lag or crash a server by spawning infinite pistols.
- Rate-limit commands to prevent client command DOS attacks against servers.
- Fixed the ability to bypass the damage filter on the gas station's rolling door by going idle.
- Fixed avoiding damage from the charger by toggling in/out of idle while being body slammed.
- Fixed clearing the boomer screenspace effect by taking a break.
- Fix griefing exploit where a survivor would fire the grenade launcher and then switch to spectator to skip the friendly-fire check
- Record the team of a vote caller at the time the vote is called, so if the caller disconnects the other players can still have their votes checked against the caller's team. Fixes team-based votes locking out new voters if the caller disconnects.
- Build a map load command on the server instead of directly executing the command that's received as part of the server reservation packet. Fixed potential server takeover exploit.
- Fixed SI ghosts playing jump landing sounds
- Prevent players from joining the survivor team as a character already occupied by a human player.
- Marked "voice_all_icons" (used for testing) as a cheat command. Clear the voice state whenever the value changes so voice bubbles don't stay visible when switching between cheat enabled/disabled games.
- Marked cl_survivor_light_* cvars as cheats.
- Made survivor_teammatefocus_* convars replicated, so they can still be used as a legitimate way to play but are forced to be consistent for all clients.
- Removed a three-second window where an infected player could force a faster transition from the observer state to the ghost state by pressing a key.
- Don't spam open/close door client commands while the door is in the process of opening or closing.

- Fixed spawn areas permanently excluded from spawn set when a survivor dies, idles, or changes character.
- Fixed mobs unable to spawn if survivors stand in specific areas during a finale.
- Always restore the default pain pills decay rate when the director resets.
- Fixed the L4D1 survivor gestures not playing on dedicated servers.
- Allow SI to destroy breakables in finale areas during survival and scavenge modes once the round begins.
- Fixed breakables sometimes failing to unblock the nav when they break.
- Don't stumble the charger if the charge attack starts while already in contact with the victim.
- Fixed L4D1 survivors not selecting their canonical preferred weapons when scavenging.
- Allow survivors to pick up ammo while fighting a tank or in close combat if they are less than 40% full.
- Bots will use pills only if health < 50
- Bots consider health to be critical at < 30 (was 40). This means real health must be < 5 before a bot will use first-aid over a full temp health buffer.
- Fixed a few cases where specials may choose to wait in an ambush position when the game mode says they should be assaulting the survivors
- If a chase path that's trying to lead the target fails, fall back to a non-leading path. Leading paths that run off a cliff aren't always handled properly and can cause the target to be treated as unreachable.
- Revised the logic for fitting both tank and witch spawn locations into the flow. Previously they would frequently collide and the witch would get culled; now they should always find some combination of spawn locations that fit the within the map constraints.
- Fixed the director's "arc value" not always handling campaigns shorter than five maps correctly.

- Allow competitive achievements (versus, scavenge) to also be earned in Versus Survival.
- Incapped survivors are counted as escaped if they're in the rescue vehicle.
- Enabled CS weapons for all players
- Viewmodels use the skin value of the world pickup model, same as gas cans.
- When a weapon is holstered, transfer the current skin to the addon model.
- Clear the viewmodel fire layer when performing a melee attack to fix the stuck helping hand bug.
- Fixed the mp5's melee shove canceling its reload animation.
- Turned on boomer gibs by default, except in low violence mode.
- Restored burn skins for infected
- Fixed witch kills getting recorded as common zombie kills in the stats.
- Increased "ammo_shotgun_max" from 56 to 72

- Removed "Single Player" option from the main menu carousel.
- Enabled the "Private Game" option in lobby permissions.
- Added a rematch vote to the end of versus survival matches.
- Fixed voice chat not working in lobbies.
- No vote cooldown in singleplayer modes
- Allow "Change all-talk" vote in versus survival mode.
- cl_downloadfilter defaults to "none"
- Fixed genericpanellist not drawing panels when they extended beyond both the top and bottom of the frame.
- Suppress warnings about func_orator not having a model

AND MORE
- Hundreds of fixes and tweaks to animations, models, dialog, map layouts and exploits.

Steam Input
- Added a Joystick style action that can receive console-style aim assist
- Fixed the Turn Around action
- Added a Reset Camera action for use with motion controls
- Rescaled mouse sensitivities so that the adjustment sliders in the configurator have more useful range
- Fix controller input on Orders/Response Quick Menus
- Fixed controllers not being able to skip to the end of the post-campaign stats scrawl

SCRIPTING AND MODDING

- CHANGES
- Run mapspawn_addon.nut for all active addons after the base version runs.
- Run scriptedmode_addon.nut and director_base_addon.nut for all active addons after the base version runs.
- Support for new population file overrides for the base game mode. So the load order is now "population.txt", "population_.txt", "population_.txt", which each script optionally overriding place definitions from the previous files.
- Any time the addon load order changes, both the director and the nav mesh immediately refresh their population data. Fixes campaigns using the wrong populations and errors from precaching the wrong models.
- Func_nav_attribute_region and point_nav_attribute_region will remove attributes if the spawn key "remove_attributes" is set to true.
- Allow scripts to force the witch bride spawn, regardless of the variant setting
- "InterceptChat" can return false to prevent sending the message to other clients.
- "DamageType" field of "ScriptAllowDamage" is now read/write, so it can be used to change the damage type.
- Fixed being unable to create subdirectories in /left4dead2/ems
- New game event "player_left_safe_area", called every time the first survivor leaves the start area regardless of map number, restarts, etc.
- Added the userid of the offending player to "triggered_car_alarm" game event.
- Fixed script funcs SetContext and SetContextNum not recognizing that a duration of zero means 'forever'. To avoid breaking existing scripts, the 'forever' parameter is now -1.
- Track convars set from script so they can be reverted when the session ends.
- New gender "police", can spawn & drop tonfas like the riot control commons, but doesn't have the protective gear.
- Added a new keyfield "weaponskin" to item and weapon spawners to set the skin of the spawned item or weapon. Supported by "weapon_item_spawn", "weapon_melee_spawn", "weapon_scavenge_item_spawn".
- Removed spurious parenthesis from "ToKVString" and "_tostring" script functions
- Director now calls into an optional script function "GetCustomScriptedStageProgress" during FINALE_CUSTOM_SCRIPTED stages. The function should return a value from 0-1 to indicate the completion percentage of the stage. The default time-based completion percentage is passed in as a parameter.
- Added weapon spawners and configurable spawner entries for CS weapons.

	 > Czech
	 > Korean
	 > Korean A (?)
	 > Romanian (DLC1 translation is only about half-finished, but DLC2 translation appears complete)
	 > Simplified Chinese
	 > Thai (Everything appears incomplete but I guess it's more than there used to be)

	- Fixed incorrect subtitle colors for Louis and Zoey in Crash Course dialogue and incorrect color for Nick in The Passing dialogue
	- Corrected jukebox song names ("Midnight Riding" -> "Midnight Ride", "Bad Man" -> "One Bad Man", "Re Your Brains" -> "Re: Your Brains")
	- Added jukebox captions for "Save Me Some Sugar" and "All I Want for Christmas (Is to Kick Your Ass)"

	- Created subtitles for placeholder "05_military" radio voices

	 > biker_worldsmalltown0511/512		"I hate boat lawyers" -> "I hate lawyers"
	 > Francis L4D1DLC2 generator
	 > NamVet_FriendlyFireFrancis
	 > Coach taunts				(taunt01, taunt03, taunt08)
	 > Coach_World02			"Oh yeah. Our goal is right next to the bridge, ON THE OTHER MOTHER F'IN SIDE OF THE RIVER!" -> "...OF THE WATER!"
	 > Teengirl incapacitatedinjury		"[Pain]AHHHHH!" -> "[Terrified yell]", for consistency with the other L4D1 characters)
	 > NamVet C6DLC3Creatures		All caps, added missing exclamation point to warncharger03
	 > manager_closethedoor03		"Lock the door, man" -> "Lock the damn door!"
	 > manager_tankpound04			WAV is a duplicate of tankpound03, but the subtitle was different
	 > All ScreamWhilePounced		i.e. manager_screamwhilepounced02 "GET IT GET IT OFF GET IT OFF!" -> "GET IT! GET IT! GET IT OFF ME, GET IT OFF ME!"
	 > Gambler_WarnJockey			Changed to all caps for consistency
	 > Biker_DLC2Intro07			"Hey. Sunshine Beams. We just CRASHED. ..." -> "Hey, Mr. Positive! We just CRASHED. ..."
	 > Biker_DLC1_C6M1_InitialMeeting06	"Hey! Are you a racecar driver?" -> "Can't! Generator's out."
	 > Properly capitalized Special Infected names (i.e. "Stop freakin' out the damn Witch.")
	 > Properly capitalzed "Army"

	- Applied the above color fixes and created merged L4D2_DLC1 and L4D1 subtitle files for the following UNSUPPORTED languages:
	 > Brazilian
	 > Bulgarian
	 > Greek
	 > Ukrainian

	- [Xanaguy] Changed the color of Bill's sacrifice "movie lines" to red to increase visibility
	- [Xanaguy] Changed the names of "Soldier 1" and "Soldier 2" to "Papa Gator" and "Rescue 7"
	- Created subtitles for dialogue from two community campaigns - Dead Before Dawn (COMPLETE) and Redemption II (Map 5 only)


*Requires L4D2 Beta branch
**Temporary or placeholder
***Work in progress

Notes:
-All higher res L4D1 textures and higher res survivor images were compressed from the source psd's. No changes were made, they were simply compressed at the resolution of the source files
-The hunting rifle no longer stores and references it's animations from it's .ani file (v_huntingrifle.ani). It is a waste of memory for an ani file to be referenced only by a single mdl. The ani file was nevertheless still updated for the few mods that actually do rely on it (mostly older ones from early 2010's). The vanilla hunting rifle should not be commiting the .ani file to memory anymore.

- The ConceptPanicEvent instances as of this update will have an additional criterion ensuring that the PanicType IS "CarAlarm". More may be identified and be put to use.

*(The intro itself will consist on moaning about the traffic being blocked, further, when any survivor but Ellis leaves the safearea, he will request that he says goodbye to the stock car alone. Then say goodbye as long as he is in the safe area too. [May improve further so that Ellis must be completely alone in the safespot, can't find the criterias for that...] He cannot be the first to leave the safe area and must stay in until the interaction is done.)

****(Chapter 2, Talk contexts have been properly applied. Improved Nick's response to coach's under-the-river tour intro so that Nick would think about assaulting francis if he is the intro actor. Cut out some unnecessary concepts. The intros will end if anyone leaves the saferoom. If Ellis is the first one out, he will be guaranteed to say a line.)

****(Chapter 3, Talk contexts have been properly applied. The intro will end if anyone leaves the saferoom.)

Improved the chapter intros to The Sacrifice.*****

*****(Chapter 1, Talk contexts have been applied. Talk:0:0 will apply when the first survivor leaves the safe area, this will not interrupt the current intros.)

### MAP FIX CHANGELOG :: VSCRIPT, LUMP FILES & MORE

Left 4 Dead 2 maps have been updated with bug and exploit fixes in addition to quality of life enhancements.
Survivor and Infected clips have been extensively re-worked to patch all out of bounds exploits.

Versus map fixes are aggressive (but fair) and Coop is extremely lax.

Credits and documentation resources can be found later in this changelog or in thread:

	Dev Thread: Map fixes for Valve
	https://steamcommunity.com/app/550/discussions/1/1651043320659915818/

Community (non-Valve) maps remain 100% un-changed, but do have access to new entity creation functions for patching.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IF YOU DON'T WANT TO READ 8000+ LINES...

You can visually render all the VScript map changes by following these steps:

	1. Right-click L4D2 in Steam Library > Properties > "SET LAUNCH OPTIONS..."

	2. Enter "-dev" (without the quotes) into the textbox

	3. Load any map via console, like "map c8m1_apartment versus"

	4. In console type "script ShowUpdate()"

	5. In console type "sb_all_bot_game 1" to prevent server shutdown

Using "versus" the above will render everything, but note that "coop" won't have new Infected ladders and will also
have far less shortcut/exploit fixes -- "survival" has a small amount of exclusive clips for specific maps.

MrFailzz made a Coop/speedrunner-focused changelog with navmesh changes here:

	https://hackmd.io/@MrFailzz/rJ5S7EZHw

If you only play Coop, please read MrFailzz' changelog instead!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

Q	Is Coop exploit X patched?

A	Most likely yes if it allowed you to go out of bounds. Otherwise no, so most shortcuts are still possible.

Q	Is Versus exploit X patched?

A	Most likely yes... extreme diligence was placed on unearthing every method of Infected attaacking from
	underneath the map, or Survivors reaching unattackable space.

Q	Why was X fixed?

A	Fixes are only spawned in for the modes they're relevant. Relevancy was determined through playtesting by
	both casual and competitive Versus players and speedrunners. In rare cases old exploits were restored
	like deleting Dark Carnival 3's swan room shelf blocker, because navmesh edits fixed the problem better.

Q	Will the VScript fixes break any addons?

A	The update will be incompatible with these addons:

		Survivor Ragdolls (Global)	https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1932686022
		Survivor Shoving Script		https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1975951464

	But I've already notified the authors they'll have to update to using mapspawn_addon.nut instead of
	mapspawn.nut. Preserved entities have also been changed, so round-persistence needs to run on "worldspawn"
	instead of say an "info_target".

Q	Can the new VScript exploit fixes be opted out of?

A	Yes, just create an empty mapspawn.nut file. This is intended to give server admins a grace period for
	reconciling redundancies within their Stripper:Source configs which will now have a lot of overlap.

Q	Can I offer map change suggestions?

A	Soon you'll be able to Subscribe to the Community Update Team's Workshop item at

		https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1959405608

	to prototype potential new exploit/bug and QoL additions to the game -- this isn't new content, just fixes,
	and Kerry Davis himself is a contributor!

Q	Haven't community configs already fixed all exploits?

A	Lots of fixes are converted from ZoneMod and other Stripper:Source community configs, but not all.
	This update includes a general clipping rework to patch even hypothetical future exploits, and
	recently-emerging exploits like crouching through displacements of which existing configs do not
	comprehensively cover. Also, solutions which work for competitive configs rarely translate well into
	vanilla -- Dark Carnival 2's hedge LOS blockers and Parish 3's fence covers are great examples which
	transitioned from ZoneMod to vanilla seamlessly, but the Midnight Riders bus did not.

Q	Was any campaign singled out for favoritism?

A	No, even Crash Course has a lot of great new ladders and a couple of unique attacks, in addition to
	completely overhauled breakwall textures which were originally missing.

Q	Was the setpause/unpause DoS spam fixed?

A	Yes, and the reason it took a while is because of doors -- when rate limiting was turned on, spamming
	doors would trip the command counter and L4D2 doesn't allow reversing the direction of a door in motion
	but open/close commands were still being spammed... requiring doors to be fixed.

Q	How do you edit pre-existing maps?

A	You can modify them from decompiled sources such as the ones at

		https://github.com/spumer/left_4_dead_2__decompiled_maps

	or by using in-game editors. SourceMod with Stripper:Source installed is what most are familiar with,
	but this update uses new VScript files anv_mapfixes.nut and anv_versus.nut for that instead.

Q	How do the new VScript files work together?

A	L4D2 now uses mapspawn.nut. Every time any map loads anv_mapfixes.nut is run in worldspawn scope to
	maintain round-persistence and avoid Mutation Game Event conflicts. Director.GetMapName() checks if it's
	a Valve map then Director.GetGameModeBase() spawns in mode-specific fixes. If it's not a Valve map, it
	does nothing. When HasPlayerControlledZombies() is true, anv_versus.nut is also run to spawn in
	Versus-specific entities, like ladders, and deletes only specific func_playerinfected_clip as needed
	to minimize the introduction of exploits that need further fixing.

Functions called by mapspawn.nut have extended L4D2 VScript with a powerful suite of one-line tools for entity handling.

+ BSP recompiles are no longer necessary when problems can be solved by cloning existing brushes.

+ Maps now patched with "anv_mapfixes.nut" instead of _commentary.txt files -- speedy code goes in, speedy fix comes out.

+ New global variables powered by "mapspawn.nut":

	g_MapName		Identical to "Director.GetMapName().tolower()"
	g_MutaMode		Identical to "Director.GetGameMode()"
	g_BaseMode		Identical to "Director.GetGameModeBase()"
	g_Chapter		Stores each "friendly name" (only for Valve campaigns)
	g_UpdateName		Prefixes "anv_mapfixes" to new entities
	g_UpdateRanOnce		Run code only once outside of "mapspawn.nut"

+ Added new feature-full entity maker and edit functions in "anv_functions.nut":

	Almost everything is a String:

		* Denotes optional parameters (wherever possible i.e. often Angles)

		^ Denotes non-String parameters (floats or integers i.e. "Init state")

		? Denotes user-friendly String options

		"Clips who?"	= Everyone | Survivors | SI Players | SI Players and AI | All and Physics
		"Team blocked?"	= Everyone | Survivors | Infected
		"Start state?"	= Apply | Remove
		"Push what?"	= Everything | Survivor | Infected | Physics
		"Hurt who?"	= Everyone | Survivor | Infected | Ghost
		"Option?"	= Duck | Walk | Jump
		"Prop type?"	= dynamic | dynamic_ovr | physics | physics_ovr
		"Shadows?"	= shadow_yes | shadow_no
		"Solidity?"	= solid_yes | solid_no
		"Team climb?"	= 0 (Both) | 1 (Survivor) | 2 (Infected)
		"Axis?"		= x+ | x- | y+ | y-

	make_clip		Targetname	Clips who?	^Init state	Box mins	Box maxs	Origin		*Angles

				! Only modify Normal if the clone was rotated -- if none, the original's is ported over

				! Infected ladders are relevant to ALL gamemodes since they can be connected to NAV mesh and used by bots!
		DEPRECATED

	InfectedHumEnts_Spawn	! No parameters: Relies on InfectedHumEnts() being declared and produces them on Versus / VS Survival / Scavenge

	devchap			Mode		! Developer indication of if "TUTORIAL", "ALL MODES", "BASE VERSUS", etc.
						! Always notifies of Anniversary Map Fixes update w/ more details if "developer 1"

+ Valve maps only: Survivor and Infected given new activator filters with names consistent across all maps!

+ VS Survival includes everything from Versus except new hittabes on c2m5, c3m3, and c10m5 are deleted.

+ Launch Option -dev for verbose entity dumps or render: "script_execute z_developer_showupdate" >> "script ShowUpdate()"

LUMP FILE FIXES

Lump file patching https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Patching_levels_with_lump_files was used instead
of VScript for more laborious fixes like adding more Versus breakwall textures. Most are outlined here.

General:

	+ Lots and lots of adjustments to floating items/weapons.

	+ Lots and lots of Survival-only clipping (some ported to VScript where relevant, i.e. events/finales).

	+ Several Scavenge-only fixes for accessing start/end safe rooms or cans going inaccessibly out of bounds.

	+ All func_illusionary breakwalls were converted to func_brush so second Versus round sees them, too.

c1m2_streets:

	+ All Whitaker stuff

	+ Breakwall textures at event area

c1m3_mall:

	+ Extra func_orator deleted (which was also solid in front of alarm button)

c1m4_atrium:

	+ Can no longer incap a teammate in the safe room and start elevator to avoid finale start.

c2m2_fairgrounds:

	+ Un-solidified func_orator at start

	+ Breakwall textures at event area and clip kill I/O added

c2m3_coaster:

	+ Breakwall texture for one-way drop wall

	+ One-way drop wall can now be destroyed by any Infected

c2m5_concert:

	+ Integrated _commentary.txt logic into lump file to prevent Survivor bots going to wrong chopper.

	+ Integrated _commentary.txt logic into lump file to eliminate one-second early escape window.

	+ Both Versus teams will now have the chopper arrive on the same side.

c4m1_milltown_a:

	+ Resolved issue where two separate doors open as if they were one.

c5m2_park:

	+ Starting safe room will stop offering a selection between identical guns.

c5m3_cemetery:

	+ End safe room ammo pile will no longer hover into the air for second Versus round.

c5m4_quarter:

	+ Breakwall textures at event area

	+ Breakwalls are always destructible (Ghosts being unable to enter is intentional for balance)

c5m5_bridge:

	+ Added a new func_orator "papa_gator"

	+ Infected ladders on the bridge now exist for second Versus round.

c6m1_riverbank:

	+ Deleted footlockers from Scavenge and Survival to resolve edict limit crash.

c6m3_port:

	+ Finale will now start even if a teammate is incapped inside the elevator.

c7m1_docks:

	+ Breakwall textures on all windows in final room

c8m2_subway:

	+ Breakwall textures on two breakable windows in generator room with I/O to delete light beams

c8m5_rooftop:

	+ Resolved the point_template that kept spawning in 100's of duplicate exploit fix brushes.

	+ Scavenge gascans will now respawn if lost by falling.

	+ Spitter acid balls will no longer linger on the bottom of the map.

c9m1_alleys:

	+ Breakwall textures at event area

c9m2_lots:

	+ Breakwall textures added to outsides of all garage doors

	+ Breakwall textures added and I/O fixed on two wooden doors

c10m3_ranchhouse:

	+ Scavenge players can no longer start the church event by pressing the invisible safe door.

c10m4_mainstreet:

	+ Breakwall textures at event area storefront

c11m4_terminal:

	+ Breakwall texture added to classroom wall (Kerry himself was aggravated he couldn't find it)

c11m5_runway:

	+ Infected ladders are moved out of view when the C130 takeoff outro starts.

VSCRIPT FIXES

This work is dedicated to two lost brothers and all those tragically lost in these horrific times of COVID-19.

Somehow we'll survive together.

Keep in mind:

	1. It's recommended to use "script ShowUpdate()" instead of reading this changelog

	2. Where "All" refers to all modes and "PvP" refers to any mode with Human-controlled Infected

	3. Provided "setpos_exact" values can be pasted into console in-game to teleport straight to the fix

	4. All clips are initially enabled except those which explicitly state "initially disabled"

	5. Every new entity is logged below, even though sometimes several are for the same fix
