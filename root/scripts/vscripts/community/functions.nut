/*****************************************************************************
**  MAKE_CLIP
**
**  All functions here are as minimalist and feature-full as possible designed
**  to create or modify entities with single lines of code. This is by far the
**  most used "make_" function and is used to replace _commentary.txt's job of
**  patching exploits with env_player_blockers that don't feel like real clips.
**
**  All parameters except angles are required. BlockTypes changed to string forms
**  such as "Everyone", with InitialState only 0 if part of I/O. It's important
**  to observe that if all angles are "0 0 0" then env_physics_blocker only pays
**  attention to "mins" and "maxs"; if they are non-0 like "1 0 0" they'll only
**  pay attention to "boxmins" and "boxmaxs". The entity's only limitation is
**  that if a clip requires angles and therefore uses boxmins/boxmaxs, then that
**  clip unavoidably blocks Physics props like gnomes/gascans -- luckily, rotated
**  clips are rarely used or placed high-up or on displacements when they are.
**
**  All confusion is easily avoided by always setting all 4 Keyvalues. Even if
**  only the specific ones necessary are set, if a "Survivor" blocker has non-0
**  angles it absolutely must use boxmins/boxmaxs to have collision with the caveat
**  that it'll inevitably block gascans/gnomes, too. It's all about placement.
**
**  "SI Players and AI" does not block Commons, but "All and Physics" blocks all
**  these (enforced even if all angles are 0):
**
**	Survivors + SI Players and AI + Common Corpses + Gascans + Gnome
**
**  If "developer 1" one-line entity descriptions are printed to console.
**  This is designed to be used with ShowUpdate() to visualize created blockers.
**
**  Entity functions almost always assume users give each entity a unique name.

**  MAKE_TRIGPUSH
**
**  Pusher volume for "Everything", "Survivor", "Infected" or "Physics".
**
**  When it comes to trigger_multiple and trigger_once their Keyvalues are so
**  specific it's more efficient to not have functions -- except push & hurt.
**
**  While versatile, undeletable SI Player wrongway signs aren't applicable here
**  because trigger_push cannot be used as a one-way barrier -- make_axiswarp()
**  was added as a way to create a one-way barrier. Even though max velocity of
**  1000 (where even 1001 spams "DataTable warning: player: Out-of-range value")
**  technically works, it was deemed far too exploitable. Use cases are reduced
**  to Quality-of-Life Infected ladder improvements and niche Survivor fixes.
**
**  "Everything" (64) even if it were instead "spawnflags 2" for NPC cannot ever
**  push Commons (Alive/Corpses) -- triggers were updated to detect weapons like
**  Gascans but not SI vomit/tongue (tongue keeps full control if pulled through).
**  Pushing is only supported on Clients (Players/AI), Physics Objects (trashbin),
**  Gnome, Pipebomb, SI acid balls, and Tank rocks. Default is always Clients (1)
**  only and if "Physics" (8) will exclude Clients. Filter Override requires the
**  full name and can be anything (i.e. an optimized filter_multi).
**
**  Push Direction format is "x y z" where x 90 is down -90 is up and z doesn't
**  effect any change. Only y is ever used.
**
**  ShowUpdate() draws all triggers YELLOW and trigger_push CANNOT be rotated;
**  however, Angles are optional because they still have unknown influence. In
**  the case of Death Toll 5's Rockslide, if Angles are all-0 instead of "0 35 0"
**  it will fail, and integrating the difference into Push Direction won't help.
**  ShowUpdate() will draw Angles but activators inside are only pushed by the
**  invisible all-0 volume. Technically Angles aren't supported but do have a
**  mild enough influence to keep as an option -- but all-0 is recommended.

**	"physics"	https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Prop_physics
**	"physics_ovr"	https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Prop_physics_override
**
**  Parameters (required unless specified):
**
**	user_strType		One of the four above (i.e. "dynamic")
**	user_strTargetname	Entity name
**	user_strModel		Full Hammer-style file path to model
**	user_strOrigin		Location
**	user_strAngles		OPTIONAL: Rotation of the prop
**	user_strShadows		OPTIONAL: Either "shadow_yes" or "shadow_no"
**	user_strSolidity	OPTIONAL: Either "solid_yes" or "solid_no"
**	user_strRenderColor	OPTIONAL: Where "0 0 0" is black
**	user_flFadeMinDist	OPTIONAL: Best left at default -1.0
**	user_flFadeMaxDist	OPTIONAL: Best left at default  0.0
**	user_flMassScale	OPTIONAL: Weight of prop_physics (1.0 default)
**
**  Fade min/max are only intended for Infected "wrongway" signs. Mass scale
**  is used to override prop_physics models that are too heavy for Tanks to hit.
**  Excluded are "StartDisabled", skins, size scaling, parenting, animations,
**  and "lightingorigin": these can be supplemented by EntFire() as required
**  but parenting will be the only one ever used by any Valve fix.
**
**  Dynamic and physics props are identical except four key differences:
**
**	1. Dynamic are solid when "solid 6" and non-solid when "solid 0".
**	   Physics are solid when "spawnflags 0" and non-solid when "spawnflags 4".
**	   Much of the code is resolving this distinction, where "spawnflags 4"
**	   is instead turning physics props into "debris".
**
**	2. Non-solid dynamic cannot be shot or hit at all whereas non-solid
**	   physics ("debris") can still be shot or hit by Tanks (but won't do
**	   any damage to victims in its trajectory).
**
**	3. Ghost Infected can freely move through physics props but dynamic
**	   props will stop them. For example, Ghosts are used to being able
**	   to run through cars, but it's the dynamic glass model that stops them.
**
**	4. Physics props are all that can use "user_flMassScale". The code
**	   ensures this parameter is ignored if it's a dynamic.
**
**  Otherwise shadows, coloring, and fade min/max are the same for all four.
**
**  Internal massScale default is 0.0 but 1.0 behaves identical and looks better.
**
**  Also note "prop_physics_override" generates "prop_physics", not _overrides.
**
**	CAUTION:
**
**  Function forces props prefixed with "_solidify" to not render. Solidifying
**  non-solid 1:1 prop_statics is critical for improving Versus LOS, with those
**  entities spawned by InfectedHumEnts_Spawn() -- which technically could do
**  it with an EntFire() but "reported ENTITY_CHANGE_NONE" spams for each. All
**  are exact copies and only cause overlap artifacts if rendered twice.

**  ENTITY HANDLING
**
**  These tiny functions are as powerful as they are potentially dangerous, SO
**  a ton of hours (and minidumps) later these should be crash/error-proof.
**
**  Function SafelyExists() accepts a Handle to an entity and returns "true"
**  if it safely exists. First and foremost the Handle must not be "null" to
**  avoid abrupt script terminations from entities we're modifying not existing,
**  THEN since it exists that much ensure it IsValid() to avoid console errors.
**
**  Function kill_entity() accepts a Handle then deletes that entity, which
**  could be Dark Carnival 5's Versus defibrillators or func_breakables deleted
**  to make room for Dead Center 1/3 ladders. Kill() needs entity to exist.
**  Note that EntFire() has a minor delay so deleting entities already in the
**  map to re-create them could backfire since it'll delete the replacement,
**  but Kill() deletes it immediately.
**
**  Function clone_model() use cases range from cloning Dark Carnival 5's brush
**  trigger that deletes players to replace it to adding new Infected ladders.
**  It relies heavily on SafelyExists() because if it returns a brush that isn't
**  the one requested the game will either spawn in the wrong brush which could
**  be anything or Crash-to-Desktop because the model isn't precached. Before
**  Kerry's C++ update to add GetModelName() & IsModelPrecached(), a more risky
**  method found the "m_nModelIndex" NetProp then did -1 to yield the String,
**  in addition to ensuring it was > 0 so it's not null or worldspawn. Conversion
**  arithmetic has been obsoleted with GetModelName(). By design this can clone
**  anything and safety ultimately relies on the user feeding in a sane Handle
**  from an entity that already exists i.e. with FindByClassnameNearest(). With
**  these protections and proper use it's 100% safe.

/*****************************************************************************
**  INFECTED LADDERS
**
**  Workflow suite of ladder fixing functions. Every ladder needs a place to
**  exist, then needs to be found for cloning, then if already exists but is
**  just broken just fix it instead, or make a new one, then spawn them in.
**
**  kill_funcinfclip()
**
**	Useful for fixing stuck spawns on Taaannnkk! Mutation most notably
**	No Mercy 3, but also necessary on maps like Blood Harvest 5 to add
**	new ladders like the barricade's -- meticulously re-creating every
**	deleted clip to prevent the introduction of exploits. Several of them
**	block off existing Infected ladders that are impossible to use.
**
**	The best way to uniquely identify these is "m_Collision.m_flRadius"
**	with values like "4564.93" -- just "m_flRadius" could be used but it
**	has "1.73922e-035" notation. As it's a brush its "m_vecOrigin" is all
**	0's often enough to disregard that for identification. Other options
**	are "m_Collision.m_vecMins"/Maxs but the radius is already LengthSqr()
**	of both so they're already represented.
**
**	Floats must be converted to String due to rare compare imprecision.
**	Before any are deleted their radius is verified unique.
**
**  find_ladder()
**
**	NetProp "m_vecSpecifiedSurroundingMaxs" is magic for several reasons:
**
**		1. If it's used correctly with "m_Collision." it will be all
**		   0's -- if it's used wrong it returns the func_simpleladder's
**		   exact world origin, presumably the same used by ent_text.
**
**		2. While m_vecMins/Maxs would also work for unique identification
**		   of ladders, the origin is much easier to understand -- but
**		   the Mins/Maxs are useful for ShowUpdate() to draw them.
**
**		3. VSSM (for short) is all 0's during and for a bit after map
**		   load -- it takes ~8 seconds to exist, varying drastically
**		   based on players and server performance.
**
**	VSSM is LengthSqr() compared to a manual user-discovered "origin",
**	looping through all func_simpleladders in the map until one within very
**	close proximity is found, then returns that ladder as a Handle.
**
**	This is the first step to patching or cloning ladders.
**
**  patch_ladder()
**
**	Accepts an "origin" to a known-existing ladder which find_ladder()
**	discovers then accepts another parameter to change its location.
**	This is used to correct Dark Carnival 4's electrical box ladder.
**
**		IMPORTANT: The "origin" changed to is relative from the
**		ladder's original location -- it has its own "center" that
**		is independent from worldspawn's "0 0 0".
**
**	An optional third parameter accepts new Normals to correct existing
**	ladders that are unclimbable due to wrong faces. This is used to
**	correct Dark Carnival 1's parking lot fence ladder.
**
**	Facing towards the ladder's "TOOLS/CLIMB_VERSUS" texture this is how
**	the Normals work -- there is a rough tolerance of 0.2 on the "raycast"
**	that determines the Normal, so 0.8 and 1.0 may yield identical results:
**
**		0 1 0		exactly North
**		0 -1 0		exactly South
**		1 0 0		exactly West
**		-1 0 0		exactly East
**
**	Now that we can fix existing ladders, let's start making our own !!
**
**  make_ladder()
**
**	Best practices for cloning Infected ladders:
**
**		+ Don't clone ladders within extreme close radius of each other
**		+ Only rotate a cloned ladder when there's no alternatives
**		+ Even if you rotate and it's still climbable still update Normals
**		+ Use "nav_edit 1; nav_show_compass 1" to visualize Normals
**		+ Average the 0.2 tolerance, so if both 0.5 and 0.7 work use 0.6
**		+ If the VSSM parameter must be rounded never round more than 0.1
**		+ The radius exists as BSP recompile and float imprecision fail-safe
**		+ Avoid very tall ladders (No Mercy 4 shaft / Blood Harvest 5 start)
**
**	Normal parameter is optional. If a ladder isn't rotated the original
**	climbable face is ported over. Override Normals when there's rotation.
**
**  InfectedLadders_Spawn()
**
**	Each map with new ladders declares InfectedLadders() and then calls
**	this function, both under "ALL MODES". A logic_timer "retry Think"
**	gives a little extra time after the first VSSM becomes non-0 to then
**	spawn in the ladders -- a necessary delay for find_ladder() to work.
**	Failure to do this will mean ladders don't spawn for the first round.
**	Second round this happens again but completes almost immediately because
**	once VSSM's are populated it's forever.
**
**	InfectedLadders() is declared in "ALL MODES" which this function relies
**	on to have been created. New ladders can be connected to NAV for bots.
**
**  ShowUpdate draws new/cloned Infected ladders in WHITE. Supplemental use of
**  make_clip() creates the "guides" on both sides of the ladder so Survivors
**  don't bump into them and make_prop() creates the visual pipes. Cloned ladders
**  do not come with new NAV connections, so SI bots and Commons can't use them.

**  of it being inside the trigger's volume instead of the standard 60 seconds.
