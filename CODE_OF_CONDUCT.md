# Code of Conduct

## Mission Statement

We aim to propose change to Valve's [Left 4 Dead 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/550/Left_4_Dead_2/) with ingenuity, inclusivity, and integrity.

## Ingenuity

We are a community pursuit. There is no license or C++ source access involved, and map recompiles are not permitted.

That does not stop us from proposing code changes that serve an expressed need, sometimes by use of open-source alternatives such as [Alien Swarm: Reactive Drop](https://github.com/ReactiveDrop/reactivedrop_public_src) which is similar to L4D2.

If there is no thinking outside the box, we might be doing it wrong.

## Inclusivity

We take our best effort toward serving as a voice for those not here with us, to represent the playerbase as much as possible.

While we like to keep things light around here, the following are worth review.

In terms of community participation:

- Discrimination of any form, and any derogatory, political, or personal attacks of any kind will not be tolerated. Please be conscious of other user's level of experience.
- Show empathy and gracefully accept constructive criticism. We all want what is best for the game and sometimes this will require us to meet others half way.
- Please keep any discussion relevant to the topic matter.

## Integrity

For the greatest chance of success, we need to be whole and undivided. It is in the best interest of L4D2 and its community to make this work smoothly.

We warrant and represent that any and all contributions (by any Github user) are of their original creation, and at worst only extend the foundation Valve has already established.

In terms of what goes into the game:

- Always be considerate of different play styles, tastes, and balance differences across modes. Check out our [Contributing Guidelines](/CONTRIBUTING.md).
- Workshop addons are important and best efforts will be taken to not break them, or to notify authors if official changes may warrant the risk.
- This is Valve's intellectual property. We are not here to radically alter character or map appearances for established base modes.

# Enforcement

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior. Please do not hesitate to contact us. All concerns or complaints will be reviewed and investigated.

## Contact

- **Tsuey** (Discord: `l4d3`)

If reporting vulnerabilities [directly to Valve](https://github.com/Tsuey/L4D2-Community-Update/security/policy) feels like overkill, feel free to contact us instead.
